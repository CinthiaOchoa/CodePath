## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- One of the most challenging parts was extracting data from the GAMES_JSON file and manipulating the objects given into index.js. This is my first time working with two javascript files and 'importing' the files together.
- I had to learn Javascript lessons on my own using Mimo.org to freshen up my JS skills before tackling the prework, that way I got more comfortable doing the prework while gaining real-world training. This will make the transition easier as I learn React in the next chapter of this course.
- Getting a grasp of using Git through GitHub is another challenge that I still need to comprehend. Through many  YouTube videos, I will get the hang of Git. This is my second attempt to commit from VSCode to GitHub correctly after making an erroneous command prompt to the demise of my terminal.
