## Notes

Building this app has been a rewarding yet challenging experience. One significant challenge I encountered was ensuring the responsiveness of the design across various devices. Adapting the layout and styles to different screen sizes required a deep dive into media queries and CSS adjustments. This was particularly challenging as I aimed to provide a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. However, with perseverance and learning about modern responsive design practices, I successfully overcame this hurdle.

Another noteworthy challenge was returning to web development after an extended hiatus. The technology landscape evolves rapidly, and catching up with the latest tools, libraries, and best practices presented a substantial learning curve. Embracing newer concepts like ES6, module systems, and responsive design frameworks demanded a considerable effort. Despite the initial challenges, the process of reacquainting myself with web development turned out to be an enriching journey, showcasing the dynamic nature of the field.

In summary, the challenges, particularly in achieving responsive design and re-entering the web development space, provided valuable learning opportunities and a sense of accomplishment as the project took shape.
