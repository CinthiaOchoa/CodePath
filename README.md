## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:

Time! I am a full-time student and I work full-time as well. I was made aware of the opportunity to take a course with CodePath just yesterday!
A coworker of mine mentioned how great of a program it seemed for me. So, late at night, after work, I looked into CodePath's website and found the application.
I submitted my application and found out there was pre-work, and would you know it's due tomorrow night after an OT (overtime) shift I had accepted just that day.
Regardless of the time and circumstances, I decided to give it my best shot to complete by deadline. This app represents 4 hours of solving the pre-work challenges
after a 10 hour work day. I am proud of what I have accomplished and I am proud that I have overcome all obstacles of exhaustion, lack of time, and anxiety, to
complete what I had dedicated myself to accomplishing.
