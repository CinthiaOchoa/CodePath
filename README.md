## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

    ðŸ’­ I was unsure of how to use certain functions and there were some new concepts that I was not aware of. However, it was similar to small assignments I have done in the past, just using a different method so I was able to get over the small road block!

    ðŸ’­ In addition, I felt that there were cases where there could've been a simpler appraoch to certain steps in the assignment, so at times I was a bit stumped on what the instructions wanted me to implement.
