## Notes

Some challenges that I encountered were the following:

- Challenge #4: With this challenge, I struggled to understand the problem at first. I initially thought the total money raised had to include only the unfunded games, rather than both funded and unfunded games.

- Displaying each game in a table: This was by far the most difficult challenge I faced. When I clicked the buttons to show only funded or unfunded games, everything worked fine. However, the issue arose when I tried to display all games. If I clicked that button first, it worked as expected. But after displaying only funded or unfunded games, clicking the "Show All Games" button created a second table inside the existing one. This resulted in multiple nested tables being displayed.
