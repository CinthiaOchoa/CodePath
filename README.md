## Notes

During this prework, I found the process of separating sections to be a bit challenging, as I wasnâ€™t entirely sure how to make the transitions look smooth and visually appealing for the user. Additionally, implementing the fade-in effect at the beginning was tricky, as I struggled to determine the best placement and approach for it.
