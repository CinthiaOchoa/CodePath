## Notes

Learning new ways to implement features and create a website was a fun experience for me, as it grew my knowledge further in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Having to learn the many Git commands, methods, and styles, I applied these skills to my project, which resulted in a website I am most proud of. There were challenges throughout this work that made me stop and think about solutions, such as the implementation of the search bar, and I had to use outside information to help me. However, in the end, it was all worth it as it resulted in a fun activity that refined my skills. I hope to continue this course and get better at software development.
