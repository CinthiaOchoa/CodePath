## Notes

<!-- Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. -->

- Getting the hero image, along with the gradient transition added on approximately 3 hours to the project - half of which was spent looking up how to do it and the other half was me being a perfectionist.
- In an effort to conserve time, I did not make the website responsive; for now, it looks best on a 3x4 screen.
- I had a hard time getting the total amount of underfunded games, even though it seemed like it would be an easy JavaScript for loop.
